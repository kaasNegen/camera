# object-detection

Demo of object detection with Python.

To run this project a couple of dependencies are needed:

- OpenCV 3.3.0 (+ opencv-contrib)
- OpenCV ImUtils
- Numpy

The model provided in this project can detect the 
following objects: 
["background", "aeroplane", "bicycle", "bird", "boat",
	"bottle", "bus", "car", "cat", "chair", "cow", "diningtable",
	"dog", "horse", "motorbike", "person", "pottedplant", "sheep",
	"sofa", "train", "tvmonitor"]
	
# How to on my pc:

- I installed pip3 version 10
- Run pip by using `pip3 install xxx`
- I installed pip3 install opencv-python (if this and simpler solutions don't work, you would have to install OpenCV via the install script)
