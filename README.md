Demo of object detection with Python.

To run this project a couple of dependencies are needed:

- OpenCV 3.3.0 (+ opencv-contrib)
- OpenCV ImUtils
- Numpy

The model provided in this project can detect the 
following objects: 
["achtergrond", "vliegtuig", "fiets", "vogel", "boot",
	"fles", "bus", "auto", "kat", "stoel", "koe", "eettafel",
	"hond", "paard", "motorfiets", "persoon", "plant", "schaap",

# How to on my pc:

- I installed pip3 version 10
- Run pip by using `pip3 install xxx`
- I installed pip3 install opencv-python (if this and simpler solutions don't work, you would have to install OpenCV via the install script)

Run real_time_object_detection to see which params are required.
real_time_object_detection_single is run as a thread inside the main code.
